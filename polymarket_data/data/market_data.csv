If the Trump administration does not impose a general tariff on the EU by June 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET this market will resolve to the lowest bracket.

If the reported value falls exactly between two brackets, then this market will resolve to the higher range bracket.

A general tariff that includes item specific exceptions will still qualify, as long as a policy of a general tariff on imports into the United States from the European Unions is enacted.

Any tariff which is officially enacted within the market's time frame will qualify, regardless of when the tariff goes into effect.

Only tariffs specifically targeting the EU will qualify. For example, a new global tariff (tariffs on all imports into the U.S.) or a tariff on specific EU member states will not count toward this market's resolution.

Territory will will be considered captured if any part of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast shaded red on the ISW map (https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/36a7f6a6f5a9448496de641cf64bd375) by the resolution date. If the area is not shaded red by April 30, 2025, 11:59 PM ET, the market will resolve to “No”.

The border between Oblasts shaded in light purple on the ISW map will not qualify. Territory across the Oblast border must be shaded red to count. 

Once Russia captures territory in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, any subsequent loss of control will not be considered towards the resolution of this market.

If Russia comes into control of territory in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast as a result of a negotiated settlement, this will qualify for a 'Yes' resolution, regardless of if it is shaded red in the ISW map. However, an announcement of a negotiated settlement which gives Russia de jure control will not qualify. Actual control must be established

The primary resolution source for this market will be the ISW Ukraine map. If the ISW map is rendered unavailable, information from DeepStateMap (https://deepstatemap.live/) may be used. If information from both the ISW and DeepStateMap are rendered permanently unavailable, a consensus of credible reporting may be used.

The deal must be a publicly announced mutual agreement. 

If such an agreement is officially reached before the resolution date, this market will resolve to ""Yes"", regardless of if/when the agreement goes into effect.

An agreement by Ukraine formally recognizing Russian sovereignty over any UN-recognized Ukrainian territory for any amount of time will count.

An agreement by Ukraine formally recognizing Russian sovereignty over any UN-recognized Ukrainian territory as a precondition of a more comprehensive peace process or deal will qualify, even if the agreement is not finalized or part of a formalized peace deal.

An official unilateral pledge by Ukraine formally recognizing Russian sovereignty over any UN-recognized Ukrainian territory will qualify for a “Yes” resolution even if not part of an agreement with Russia.

The April 19, 2013, Brussels Agreement between Serbia and Kosovo, in which Serbia recognized Kosovo’s de facto administration but did not formally grant de jure recognition, would not be considered a qualifying agreement under this market, as this market requires formal recognition of sovereignty rather than acknowledgment of administrative control.

The primary resolution source for this market will be an official announcement by Ukraine and/or the Russian Federation, however, an overwhelming consensus of credible reporting confirming an agreement has been reached will also qualify.

Otherwise, this market will resolve to ""No.""

Eliminating carried interest is defined as preventing investment fund managers from classifying carried interest as long-term capital gains rather than ordinary income. Legislation or executive actions that modify but do not fully eliminate the carried interest provision—such as increasing the holding period or altering tax rates without removing the provision entirely—will not qualify. 

Any law or executive action meeting these criteria will count, even if its implementation is immediately halted or delayed by judicial or other actions.

Any bill signed into law or executive action taken within this market's timeframe will qualify, regardless of when the law or action goes into effect.

The deal must be a publicly announced mutual agreement or otherwise confirmed by an overwhelming consensus of credible reporting.

The intersection station will be considered captured if any part of the intersection is shaded red on the ISW map (https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/36a7f6a6f5a9448496de641cf64bd375) by the resolution date.

An announcement of the withdrawal of a permanent U.S. troop presence will count, even if rotational deployments remain. Likewise, an announcement of the end of rotational deployments in a country that does not have a permanent U.S. troop presence will also count, however announcements of force reductions, or partial withdrawals will not qualify. 

Any official announcement made within in this market's timeframe will qualify, regardless of if/when the policy is implemented.

Any country which includes a former Warsaw Pact country will count (e.g. Germany,  Czech Republic, Slovakia, qualify).

The resolution source will be official information from the Trump administration however a consensus of credible repeating may also be used.
